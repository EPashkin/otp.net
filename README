OTP.NET
=======

This project implements Erlang Distribution Protocol in .NET and also provides class
abstractions of all Erlang primitive types with ability to match terms.

This is a fork of OTP.NET found in: http://jungerl.sourceforge.net
This folk has many bug fixes, and new features, such as Erlang term construction from
strings `Erlang.Object.Format()`, pattern matching `Erlang.Object.match()`, and more
(see `Otp/release_notes.txt` for changes).
